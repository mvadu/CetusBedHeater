## Libraries.

1. DS18B20
I wanted to understand Maxim 1 wire protocol, so I wrote this one. ANy standard one wire library would have worked for the purposes of this project.

2. HTU21D
Supports both HTU21D and SHT21D sensors. Reads Temperature and humidity from SPI sensor, and optionally calculates dew point and heat index.
